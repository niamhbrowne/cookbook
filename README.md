# MS3 Project - Cookbook 
## UX
### Project Goals
* Design a web page using Flask, CS, HTML, JS
* To design a functioning web page that people can use to find recipes
* Create a web page that can be added to in the future
* Create a simplistic web page so it doesn't bombard users
* Implement google maps to show locations across the globe that the food originated from
* Have links to social media
* Have a clear navbar to help users navigate their way through the page 
### User Goals
* Find recipes easily
* To share my recipes with other users
* To see images of food to gain inspiration for how to plate dishes
* To easily navigate through the website
### Developer Goals
* As a developer I want a webpage that I can add to in the future.
* As a developer I want a clearly laid out webpage and code so I can clearly see where each section is.
* As a developer I want to be able to easily change/ remove / add recipes.
### User Stories
* As a user I want to be able to look up recipes and see images of what the end product should look like.
* As a user I want to learn how to create meals with easy to read step by step instructions.
* As a user I want to have a selection of cuisines to choose from.
* As a user I would like the oportunity to share my own recipe ideas.
* As a user I want to see loads of images of tasty looking food.
### Design Choices 
I chose a simplistic webpage design as I don't want to over complicate it.  I want users to easily find their way through the webpage and therefore have chosen to use a simple navbar with dropdown links to help users choose what they want to see quickly and easily. I want to add loads of images to keep users interested in the page.  I am going to use google maps as well to create user interactivity.  I will have a form on the last link on the navbar which users can add their own recipes. I am going to create an interactive webpage that users can easily understand and use.

## Technologies Used

## Testing 
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript validators to test the coding aspect of my project and they passed for both. As for the visual aspect of the project I tested it through opening it on a web page browser and clicking on all the links in the navigation menu and reading through each section. I also inspected the code on the browser and looked at it on the IPad Pro and mobile phone devices to make sure it was working on all screen sizes. I clicked through all the links on the navigation bar to ensure there were no broken links and that external links opened on a new tab. I used the contact form to ensure it was working and also moved the google maps around to make sure it was working as well.
### Bugs Discovered 
* Due to my templates being in folders of their own, I had to move back a level to get back to the root folder in order to get the href links to connect.
* On the home page the headings for the thumbnails were displaying at different levels on the page. To solve this bug I added breaks (< br >) at the end of the headings so they'd all be on the same level.
