* As a user I want to have a selection of cuisines to choose from.
* As a user I would like the oportunity to share my own recipe ideas.
* As a user I want to see loads of images of tasty looking food.
### Design Choices 
I chose a simplistic webpage design as I don't want to over complicate it.  I want users to easily find their way through the webpage and therefore have chosen to use a simple navbar with dropdown links to help users choose what they want to see quickly and easily. I want to add loads of images to keep users interested in the page.  I am going to use google maps as well to create user interactivity.  I will have a form on the last link on the navbar which users can add their own recipes. I am going to create an interactive webpage that users can easily understand and use.

## Testing 
### Bugs Discovered 
* Due to my templates being in folders of their own, I had to move back a level to get back to the root folder in order to get the href links to connect.
* On the home page the headings for the thumbnails were displaying at different levels on the page. To solve this bug I added breaks (< br >) at the end of the headings so they'd all be on the same level.
