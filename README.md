## UX
### Project Goals
* Design a web page using Flask, CS, HTML, JS
* To design a functioning web page that people can use to find recipes
* Create a web page that can be added to in the future
* Create a simplistic web page so it doesn't bombard users
* Implement google maps to show locations across the globe that the food originated from
* Have links to social media
* Have a clear navbar to help users navigate their way through the page 
### User Goals
* Find recipes easily
* To share my recipes with other users
* To see images of food to gain inspiration for how to plate dishes
* To easily navigate through the website
### Developer Goals
* As a developer I want a webpage that I can add to in the future.
* As a developer I want a clearly laid out webpage and code so I can clearly see where each section is.
* As a developer I want to be able to easily change/ remove / add recipes.
### User Stories
* As a user I want to be able to look up recipes and see images of what the end product should look like.
* As a user I want to learn how to create meals with easy to read step by step instructions.
* As a user I want to have a selection of cuisines to choose from.
* As a user I would like the oportunity to share my own recipe ideas.
* As a user I want to see loads of images of tasty looking food.
### Design Choices 
I chose a simplistic webpage design as I don't want to over complicate it.  I want users to easily find their way through the webpage and therefore have chosen to use a simple navbar with dropdown links to help users choose what they want to see quickly and easily. I want to add loads of images to keep users interested in the page.  I am going to use google maps as well to create user interactivity.  I will have a form on the last link on the navbar which users can add their own recipes. I am going to create an interactive webpage that users can easily understand and use.

## Technologies Used
For my third milestone project I used a number of technologies to assist in developing my website which I have listed below.

* I used Bootstrap throughout the project to create, the navbar, carousels and the form for users to submit their own recipes
* I used Google Maps to create a map on the main pages to show visiting users where the food from the recipes originated from
* I used the google search engine to help me solve problems with my code, find inspiration for the design on the website through looking at other online cookbook sites and to find out how to code certain aspects as well.
* I used the online tutorials as well to help find greater understanding for how the code works and how to impliment it as best as possible.
## Testing 
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript validators to test the coding aspect of my project and they passed for both. As for the visual aspect of the project I tested it through opening it on a web page browser and clicking on all the links in the navigation menu and reading through each section. I also inspected the code on the browser and looked at it on the IPad Pro and mobile phone devices to make sure it was working on all screen sizes. I clicked through all the links on the navigation bar to ensure there were no broken links and that external links opened on a new tab. I used the contact form to ensure it was working and also moved the google maps around to make sure it was working as well.
### Bugs Discovered 
* Due to my templates being in folders of their own, I had to move back a level to get back to the root folder in order to get the href links to connect.
* On the home page the headings for the thumbnails were displaying at different levels on the page. To solve this bug I added breaks (< br >) at the end of the headings so they'd all be on the same level.

## Deployment 
I used Gitpod to code the web page and then pushed it to Github. I used clear, descriptive and short commit messages throughout the project to show clearly each step of the project. I used the preview on Gitpod and open browser to see the design during the process of coding. Once finished coding I tested the web page by opening the web page on a browser to make sure all changes were saved and working properly.

### Gitpod
Steps I used on Gitpod to deploy my webpage:

* I used clear and concise commits throughout the development of the webpage
* I used git add to save the files
* I used Git push to push the code to Github

### Github
Steps I used on Github to deploy my webpage:

* I created a Github repository for the project
* Once the repository was created I used gitpod to develop it
* I went into the settings and at the github page section I changed the Branch from none to main to get the live link for the webpage

## Credits
### Content
I got all my recipes from Gousto Cookbook. Gousto Cookbook is all public and therefore not illegal to use for the purpose of my project. I used their images and images from Allrecipes as well to create the thumbnails and images on the carousels.
