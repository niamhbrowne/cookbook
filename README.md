## Testing 
### Bugs Discovered 
* Due to my templates being in folders of their own, I had to move back a level to get back to the root folder in order to get the href links to connect.
* On the home page the headings for the thumbnails were displaying at different levels on the page. To solve this bug I added breaks (< br >) at the end of the headings so they'd all be on the same level.
